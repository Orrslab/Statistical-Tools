# Statistical Tools

This repository contains general statistical tools developed by members of the lab.
These tools are designed to make it easier to generate publication-ready tables, 
perform model diagnostics, and automate common statistical workflows.

## Contents
- `GLMMsummary2docx.R`: a function that converts GLMM model outputs into a clean Word table.
- [More tools to come...]

## Contribution
